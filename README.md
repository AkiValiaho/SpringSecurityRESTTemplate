# SpringSecurityRESTTemplate
Useful template for developing RESTful applications with Spring and Spring Security.


This project contains a Spring Security project using JWT Tokens as a way of
providing persistence in stateless context of REST.

There is an existing mapping for a typical Java EE-pattern. Controllers, services and domain objects
are organised in separate packages.

Database object relational mapping is handled by Hibernate.

It has a configurable CORS-filter defined and a simple CustomUserDetails-implementation
that can be used for example implementing a custom cache functionality and/or a database backed
authentication.

Backend is configured to redirect HTTP into HTTPS. Mappings are modular and can be changed in
application.properties.

Maven Clean Install triggers building for the frontend as well as Spring Boot.
There is a Gulp process that moves frontend files to the target-folder under their own document root.

Project has a static angular.js frontend with some stylish bootstrap styling :)
